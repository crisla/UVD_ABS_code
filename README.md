Unemployment Variance Decomposition a la ABS - The Code

This repository stores the accompanying code to our paper "Unemployment Duration Variance Decomposition a la ABS: Evidence from Spain", by Maia Guell and Cristina Lafuente.

The code is written in STATA .do files, which calculate and decompose the variance of unemployment in Spain, and Python notebooks, that produce the plots and the LaTeX tables for the paper. Other supplementary plots are also produced in Python.

For further details, please refer to the Instructions.pdf file.

NOTE: As of today (22/03/2019) the code that generate the core results is already functional. Once access to the data is obtained (see Instructions file for details) running the code reproduces the figures of the paper. However in the next few weeks it is likely that the code will be changed and improved.

Any typos or other queries, please open an Issue!
