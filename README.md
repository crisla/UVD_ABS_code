Unemployment Variance Decomposition a la ABS - The Code

This repository stores the accompanying code to our paper "Unemployment Duration Variance Decomposition a la ABS: Evidence from Spain", by Maia Guell and Cristina Lafuente.

The code is written in STATA .do files, which calculate and decompose the variance of unemployment in Spain, and Python, that produce the plots and the LaTeX tables for the paper. Other supplementary plots are also produced in Python.

For further details, please refer to the Instructions.pdf file.

NOTE: As of today (22/3/2019) there are still some files pending to upload for the supplementary plots, but the code that generate the core results is already functional. Once access to the data is requested, it reproduces the figures of the paper.

Any typos of queries, please open an Issue!
